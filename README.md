# Covid-19 Dashboard and Stay Home Tracker 

Since the outbreak of corona virus, we have been doing the hard work to "Flatten the curve". I feel that it is necessary to visualize the confirmed cases so that we can see it easily. This dashboard shows the Australian confirmed cases in visual graphs using chart.js and react. At the same time, we need to be motivated to stay at home to prevent further spread of the virus. I have created the Stay Home Tracker in order to keep track of hours spent outside home.  

## Live demo :earth_asia:
